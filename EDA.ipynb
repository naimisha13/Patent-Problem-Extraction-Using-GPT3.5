      "\n",
      "FIG. 1 shows a lateral side view of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention wherein a plurality of resilient composite structures are configured as spokes 100 and are attached to an outer tread band 200 forming a part of a tire 10. The tire 10 may be incorporated into a wheel. For example the tire 10 may be part of non-pneumatic wheel having a hub 12 which is attached to a passenger vehicle allowing the vehicle to roll across a ground surface. Other objects and vehicles may incorporate the invention, including but not limited to: heavy duty truck, trailer, light truck, off-road, ATV, bus, aircraft, agricultural, mining, bicycle, motorcycle and passenger vehicle tires. Such a non-pneumatic wheel would possess a hub 12 that would have a radially outer surface having an axis of revolution about a central axis 20. The tire 10 may be attached to the hub 12 by any of a number of methods, for example, by mechanical fasteners such as bolts, screws, clamps or slots, and/or by adhesives such as cyanoacrylates, polyurethane adhesives, and/or by other bonding materials or a combination thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tire 10 shown here possesses an axis of rotation 20 about which the tire 10 rotates. In this exemplary embodiment, the radially outer surface 230 of the outer tread band 200 interfaces with a ground surface 30 over which the tire rolls. Under a nominal load, the spokes 100 of the tire flex as the tire enter and exit the contact patch. Smaller deflections occur in the spokes 100 as the spoke rotates about the axis 20 outside the contact patch, but most of the deflection occurs while the spoke 100 enters, exits and travels through the contact patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each spoke 100 possesses a &#x201c;nose&#x201d; portion 130 which acts as a resilient hinge. The &#x201c;nose&#x201d; portion 130 is an elastomeric joint body connecting a support element forming the radially inner portion of the spoke and a support element forming the radially outer portion of the spoke. The support elements of the spoke 100 are initially positioned at an angle relative to each other. The angle between the spoke support elements measuring less than 180 degrees is the interior angle and the angle between the spoke support elements measuring greater than 180 degrees is the exterior angle. The elastomeric joint is comprised of an elastomer attached to each spoke support element and is positioned on the side of the spoke elements on the interior angle side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The radially inner portion of the spoke possesses a radially inner foot 112 which connects to another surface, which is the radially outer surface of the hub 12 in the present embodiment. In the present embodiment, the radially inner foot 112 is comprised of an elastomeric joint body that connects the radially outer support to the hub 12. The radially outer portion of the spoke 100 possesses a radially outer foot 114 which is comprised of another elastomeric body which connects the outer support element to yet another surface which is in the present embodiment the radially inner surface of the outer tread band 200.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the exemplary embodiment shown, the tread band 200 comprises an elastomeric material and allows deformation to form a planar footprint in the contact patch. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the radially outer foot 114 of the spoke 100 is attached to the radially inner surface 202 of the tread band 200 and to the opposite side of the support element from the nose portion 130. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the spoke is adhered in place by a cyanoacrylate adhesive. In other embodiments, the spoke may be attached by other methods, including by adhering the elastomeric material together, for instance by using green rubber and curing the rubber components together, or using a strip of green rubber between cured or partially cured rubber components. In some embodiments, the outer tread band 200 may also possess a reinforcement to help carry the load circumferentially around the tire.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this particular embodiment, the size of the tire 100 is 205/55R16 with the lateral width of the tread being about 165 mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIG. 2 shows the exemplary embodiment of the invention, configured as a spoke in a wheel 10, where the embodiment is loaded in excess of its nominal load. In this particular instance, the tire was loaded with 1000 kg of mass load (approximately 9800 N force). In this case the deflection exceeded 20 mm and resulted in contact between the spoke nose portion 130 and spoke foot portions 110. Under such conditions, the nose and foot portions act as a &#x201c;bump stop&#x201d; unloading the leg portions of the spoke. The individual spokes 100 in this situation may make contact with one another as they enter, exit and or travel through the contact patch. The contact is illustrated as occurring between the nose portion 130 and the radially outer foot 114 where the spokes are entering the contact patch and contact is illustrated as occurring between the nose portion 130 and the radially inner foot portion 112 where the spokes are exiting the contact patch. While contact of an individual spoke with the spoke adjacent to it may occur, a portion of the load may be transferred in this case, through the radially inner foot 112, through the nose portion of the spoke 100, through the radially outer foot 114 and through the outer tread band 200 to the ground 30. In a sense, the shape of the spokes of the present embodiment shown may act as a &#x201c;bump stop&#x201d; to prevent structural damage to the support elements or legs of the spoke connecting the feet 112, 114 with the nose 130 of the spoke. Such conditions of loading in excess of the nominal load could occur with overloading the vehicle with excess mass, or could occur if the tire encounters an obstacle, such as a curb, while traveling at high speed. While this particular embodiment behaves in this particular manner, other embodiments of the invention may behave differently, and may or may not exhibit &#x201c;bump stop&#x201d; qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the embodiment shown, the outer band 200 possesses reinforcement 210 to strengthen the outer band. A tread 230 is provided on the radially outer surface of the outer band 200.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIG. 3 provides a perspective view of the spoke 100 embodiment. In this particular embodiment, the spoke maintains a similar cross section profile in the lateral direction of the spoke. It can be seen that the feet 110, both the radially inner foot 112 and radially outer foot 114, each provide an attachment point to the hub 12 and outer band 200 of the wheel 10. A widening in the circumferential direction at the radially inner end of the radially inner foot 112 provides circumferentially broad surface 122 for attachment, such as adhering, bonding and/or mechanically, to the hub 12. Likewise a widening in the circumferential direction at the radially outer end of the radially outer foot 114 provides circumferentially broad surface 124 for attachment, such as adhering, bonding and/or mechanically, to the outer tread band 200. The radially inner surface 122 and radially outer surface 124 in the embodiment shown are shown to be slightly curved in the circumferential direction of the spoke to match the radius of curvature of the hub and radially inner surface 202 of the outer band 200 at the location where the spoke attaches in the respective positions. Alternatively, the surface of the radially inner surface 122 and radially outer surface 124 may also be flat in the circumferential direction of the spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nose portion, or otherwise referred to as the &#x201c;joint body&#x201d; 130 of the spoke 100 of the embodiment shown is comprised of an elastomeric material and acts to connect a first and second support element, here comprising a radially inner leg 142 and a radially outer leg 144 respectively. The nose portion becomes thicker in the circumferential direction between the radially inner leg 142 and radially outer leg 144. The circumferential direction of the spoke should be understood in this embodiment to be the same as the circumferential direction of the wheel 10. In reference to a single spoke as shown in this embodiment, the circumferential direction is generally orthogonal to both the radial direction and the lateral direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be observed that the radially inner leg 142 is slightly shorter than the radially outer leg 142 in the embodiment shown. This difference in length accommodates the change in radius as the spoke travels through the contact patch maximizing the space available for the adjacent spokes to &#x201c;nest.&#x201d;\n",
      "\n",
      "FIG. 4 shows a front view of the spoke in a circumferential direction. The radially inner surface possesses a first and second protrusion 166, 168 which creates radially inner surface 122 that is curved in the lateral direction. This causes the cross section of the spoke 100 to vary slightly in the lateral direction. In alternative embodiments the spoke 100 may maintain an identical cross section in the lateral direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIG. 5 shows a section view of the embodiment showing the main components of the spoke 100. The spoke 100 of the embodiment shown is comprised of rubber of the general type used in the construction of conventional rubber pneumatic radial tires, polyester cord material and fiberglass reinforced resin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rubber used in the embodiment shown comprises of a relatively soft rubber having a modulus of 4.8 MPa in the areas of the radially inner elastomeric joint body 112 and radially outer elastomeric joint body 114. Each elastomeric joint body 112, 114 is attached to the radially inner leg 142 and radially outer leg 144 respectively. The radially inner leg 142 and radially outer leg 144 are constructed to give them flexural rigidity, that is, to allow them to resiliently deform when the spoke 100 is under compression or tension. The radially outer end 148 of the radially outer leg 144 is attached to the elastomeric joint body 114, but is otherwise &#x201c;free&#x201d; and may move to compress or stretch the elastomeric joint body 114 when the spoke is being stretched or compressed. Likewise the radially inner end 146 of the radially inner leg 142 is attached to the elastomeric joint body 112, but is otherwise &#x201c;free&#x201d; and may move to compress or stretch the elastomeric joint body 112 when the spoke 100 is under compression or tension. The radially inner elastomeric joint body 112 becomes thicker in the circumferential direction nearer the hub 12 to which it is attached. In the embodiment shown, the elastomeric joint body 112 flairs outward forming a protrusion 116 nearest the hub 10. Likewise, the radially outer elastomeric joint body 114 becomes thicker in the circumferential direction nearer the outer band 200 to which it is attached. In the embodiment shown, the elastomeric joint body 114 flairs outward forming a protrusion 118 nearest the outer band 200.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the embodiment shown, a membrane 132 is used to reinforce the nose section 130 of the spoke 100. The membrane structure 132 of the embodiment shown is comprised of polyester fibers made from an 1100 by 2 cord with a pace of approximately 1 mm and a tensile modulus of approximately 3,750 MPa. Such reinforcement fibers are similar to that commonly used in the radial cords of a pneumatic tire. The rubber surrounding the reinforcements of the membrane has a modulus of approximately 5 MPa. For the embodiment shown, this rubber is of a type used in the construction of a conventional pneumatic radial tire. Alternatively, other membrane reinforcement materials may be used, including using cords of other materials, such as aramid, cotton, nylon or rayon or combinations thereof. Alternatively, the reinforcement pace, filament count, cord count and diameter may vary. In the embodiment shown, the reinforcement membrane 132 extends approximately one-fifth of the height of the spokes, generally co-extensive with the generally triangular shaped nose elastomeric joint body 136. In the embodiment shown, the elastomeric joint body 136 thickens and flairs outward in the circumferential direction near the middle section between the radially inner and radially outer spoke legs 142, 144, forming a protrusion 138 at approximately the midpoint of the elastomeric joint body 136.\n",

In this particular embodiment, the filaments have a diameter of approximately 1 mm with a pace of about 2 mm apart. The filaments of the particular embodiment shown are glass reinforced resin formed by pultrusion. The filaments of the embodiment have a modulus of approximately 10 MPa. Alternatively other reinforcements may be used, including carbon fiber such as graphite epoxy, glass epoxy or aramid reinforced resins or epoxy or combinations thereof. Unreinforced plastic reinforcements or metallic reinforcements may also be used, provided they have sufficient flexural rigidity for the nominal loads intended to be supported. Alternatively other pacing and other diameters diameter of the membranes and reinforcements may be used. The legs 142, 144 of the spoke 100 have a relatively large stiffness compared to the other components comprising the spoke 100. The legs 142, 144 resist act resiliently and have a large bending stiffness allowing the nose portion 130 of the spoke to act as a joint body connecting the radially inner leg 142 with the radially outer leg 144. The feet 112, 114 act as second and third joint bodies, connecting the radially inner leg 142 to the hub and the radially outer leg 144 with the outer band 200.\n",

The invention aims to provide a composite spring that is deflectable in at least one plane of bending and that can provide support to a tire while also being able to absorb shock and vibration. Additionally, the invention may be directed towards providing a spoke for a tire that is flexible and able to deflect in at least one plane of bending, while still providing support to the tire."
